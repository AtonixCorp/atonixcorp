# PennyLane engine scaffold (demo)

This folder contains a small scaffold for integrating PennyLane (for hybrid quantum/classical ML).

Install dependencies (dev):

```bash
pip install pennylane
```

PennyLane integrates with many device backends; implement wrappers to target specific devices/adapters.
