## 🔐 Security Guidance & Frameworks

We adhere to industry-standard security frameworks to guide our architecture and operations:

### Guiding Principles

- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multi-layered security across network, application, identity, and data layers
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every access request is verified, authenticated, and authorized
- **Secure-by-Default**: All services and environments ship with security controls enabled
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and anomaly alerting across infrastructure
- **Least Privilege**: Users and services get minimum required permissions
- **Defense Automation**: Security controls embedded into CI/CD pipelines

### Industry Standards & Frameworks

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Foundation for security program
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Operating system, container, and application hardening
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Information security management system standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security best practices
- **PCI-DSS v3.2.1**: Payment card industry compliance requirements
- **GDPR & CCPA**: Data privacy and protection regulations

   FROM ubuntu:22.04
   RUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser
   USER appuser
✅ Apply read-only root filesystem where possible
✅ Don't run privileged containers
✅ Limit container capabilities
   --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE
✅ Set memory and CPU limits
   --memory=512m --cpus="0.5"
✅ Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Grype)
✅ Use private container registries
✅ Sign container images (Notary, Cosign)
✅ Apply image policies and admission controllers
✅ Keep container runtime updated
```

### Network Security Hardening

```yaml
# Network Policies - Deny All by Default
Security Configuration:
  ✅ Default deny ingress and egress rules
  ✅ Allow only required traffic
  ✅ Implement network microsegmentation

  ✅ Use hardware security keys (U2F/WebAuthn)
  ✅ Rotate SSH keys quarterly
  ✅ Disable password authentication for service accounts
  ✅ Implement password complexity requirements
  ✅ Set password expiration (90 days)
  ✅ Lock accounts after 5 failed attempts
  ✅ Log all authentication attempts
  ✅ Implement session timeout (15 minutes idle)

Authorization:
  ✅ Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  ✅ Apply Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
  ✅ Review permissions quarterly
  ✅ Implement approval workflows for privileged access
  ✅ Separate duties between roles
  ✅ Maintain audit trails
```

## 🛡️ Controls & Enforcement

Security controls are embedded into infrastructure, application code, and CI/CD pipelines for consistent enforcement across all deployments.

### Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Security

**Location**: `/security/hardening/terraform-security/`

All infrastructure must be defined with security defaults:
- Encryption enabled at rest and in transit
- Firewall rules follow least privilege principle
- IAM policies restrict access appropriately
- Audit logging configured for all services
- Network segmentation enforced

### CI/CD Pipeline Security

**Location**: `/security/hardening/ci-cd/`

Security checks embedded in all deployment pipelines:
- Secrets detection (gitleaks, truffleHog)
- Vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- SAST analysis (Bandit, SonarQube)
- Dependency checking (Safety, OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Container scanning before deployment
- Code review required (minimum 2 approvals)
- Automated security testing

### Security Controls in Application Code

**Location**: `/backend/atonixcorp/security/`

All applications implement:
- Input/output validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (content security policies)
- CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Severity and Remediation Guidance

We use CVSS v3 where applicable to classify severity. General guidance:
- Critical (CVSS ≥ 9): immediate action and patch release
- High (7–8.9): patch in a short cadence (days to weeks)
- Medium (4–6.9): scheduled fix (weeks)
- Low (<4): tracked for future releases

When possible, include recommended remediation steps and mitigations in the report to speed up resolution.

---

## Safe Harbor

If you follow this policy and act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or service disruption, we will not pursue legal action against security researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices.

Do not perform testing that could harm user data or production services without prior authorization.
